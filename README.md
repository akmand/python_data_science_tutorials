   - **Python vs. R**: Compare Python and R, two popular languages for data analysis. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each and see how to perform similar tasks in both languages.

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Jupyter yet, you can do so by following the instructions on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

Once Jupyter is installed, you can clone this repository and open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
jupyter notebook
